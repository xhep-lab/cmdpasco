This is a low-level, cross-platform command prompt interface to PASCO Bluetooth devices. There are commands to scan, connect, disconnect and record data from devices etc.

## âœ¨ Install

The code aims to be cross-platform. Installation by

    pipx install git+https://github.com/xhep-lab/cmdpasco.git

## ðŸ“ˆ Run

Start the command prompt by

    cmdpasco

For help, enter `?` or `help` at the prompt. There are commands for

- `scan`: scan for available PASCO Bluetooth devices
- `connect`: connect to a PASCO Bluetooth device using the six-digit device code
- `info`: show information about connected devices
- `record`: record data from connected devices to disk
- `watch`: plot data from connected devices in real time

E.g., here we connect to a device by ID number, record data at 1 second intervals, disconnect, and quit:

```bash
andrew@workstation:~$ cmdpasco
Welcome to the PASCO shell. Type help or ? to list commands.

(disconnected) connect 178-396
Device Smart Cart 178-396 connected
(Smart Cart 178-396) record 1
Saved data to cmdpasco_data_2025_09_01_15_26_54.txt
(Smart Cart 178-396) disconnect
Device Smart Cart 178-396 disconnected
(disconnected) quit
```

## ðŸ’¡ Contribute

Contributions are strongly enouraged, especially from students using PASCO devices. Possibilities include:

- installation by Conda
- `watch` command that supports multiple measurements to watch
- `record` command that allows recorded data to be filtered
- Mock devices for testing - it's hard to develop the code as you have to have a PASCO device handy. Can we have a mock device for testing?
- And of course bug fixes!
